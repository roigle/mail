# mail
A front-end for an email client that makes API calls to send and receive emails.

Once registered, the user is able to send, receive and reply to emails. They can also 'archive' and 'unarchive' the emails.

The site is made with Django for the backend and JavaScript for the front. It is a single page site, using 'fetch' and avoiding the reload of the page.

This is the forth project for CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript. Project finished in November 2021. Full specifications can be found here: https://cs50.harvard.edu/web/2020/projects/3/mail/
